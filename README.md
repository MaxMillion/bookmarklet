Bookmarklets with CGI code
==========================

The first JS bookmarklet captures any highlighted text on a webpage and sends it to a database (it creates one for you) on localhost. The second JS bookmarklet queries the database and displays the results, from URL to date to the actual text highlighted. It uses a simple Bootstrap interface for the local webserver's index.html. It can search the database by Date and URL.
